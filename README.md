Snake Game README
Overview
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body while trying to achieve the highest possible score.

Features
Simple and intuitive controls.
Dynamic gameplay with a growing snake.
Randomly generated food items.
Scoreboard to keep track of current and high scores.
Game over state when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Getting Started
To run the Snake Game, ensure you have Python and the turtle graphics library installed. Follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
Run the game:

bash
Copy code
python snake_game.py
Controls
Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
Game Logic
The game consists of several key components:

Snake Movement: The snake moves forward and grows when it eats food.
Food Generation: Food items are placed randomly on the screen, ensuring they do not overlap with the snake.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions with the walls and the snake’s own body.
Development Tips
As you explore and modify the code, consider the following:

Reflect on how the game resets after a game over. What improvements could enhance the experience?
Take note of variable usage, particularly how they are initialized and manipulated throughout the game.
Examine the structure of the movement functions. Is there a way to streamline them for better clarity?
Pay attention to when the screen is updated. Timing can affect performance and user experience.
Think about the user experience after a game ends. What features or information would improve replayability?

Development Hints
As you explore and modify the code, consider the following hints to enhance your learning experience:

Game Reset Logic: Think about how the game resets after a game over. What improvements could you implement to make this process more effective?
Variable Initialization: Pay attention to how variables are initialized and used throughout the game. Are there instances where they might not be properly set? How would you address this?
Redundant Code: Look for any repetitive logic within the movement functions. Can you refactor this code to improve clarity and efficiency?
Screen Update Timing: Observe when screen updates occur in the game. How could you optimize these updates to enhance performance and user experience?
Game Over Experience: Consider what happens after a game ends. What features or feedback could be added to improve the player's experience upon finishing the game?
Notes for Improvement
Function Naming: Consider renaming pluse to something more descriptive, like grow.
Redundant Code: The logic for moving and growing the snake may be streamlined to avoid redundancy.
Game Reset Logic: Ensure that when resetting, all game state variables are appropriately initialized.
Initialization: Make sure all variables are properly set before use to avoid potential errors.
Screen Updates: Review where and how often you are updating the screen to optimize performance.
