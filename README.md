# Snake Game

## Overview
The **Snake Game** is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body while trying to achieve the highest possible score.

---

## Features
- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Dynamic gameplay with a growing snake.
- Randomly generated food items.
- **Scoreboard** to track current and high scores.
- **Game Over** state when the snake collides with itself or the walls.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the Snake Game, ensure you have **Python** and the **turtle graphics** library installed.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RamanRed/hacktberfest-4.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. **Run the game**:

   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
- **Objective**: Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

---

## Game Logic

- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves forward and grows when it eats food.
- **Food Generation**: Food items are placed randomly on the screen, ensuring they do not overlap with the snake.
- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions with the walls and the snake’s own body.

## Development Tips
As you explore and modify the code, keep the following tips in mind:

1. **Game Reset Logic**: Reflect on how the game resets after a game over. What improvements could enhance the player experience?
2. **Variable Usage**: Pay attention to how variables are initialized and manipulated throughout the game.
3. **Movement Functions**: Examine the structure of the movement functions. Is there a way to streamline them for better clarity?
4. **Screen Updates**: Observe when the screen is updated. Timing can affect performance and user experience.
5. **Game Over Experience**: Consider how to improve replayability by enhancing the experience after a game ends.

## Development Hints

- **Game Reset Logic**: Consider how the game resets after a game over. What improvements could make this process more effective?
- **Variable Initialization**: Ensure variables are properly initialized and set throughout the game to avoid errors.
- **Redundant Code**: Look for repetitive logic, especially within movement functions. Refactor for better clarity and efficiency.
- **Screen Update Timing**: Optimize screen updates to enhance performance and user experience.
- **Game Over Experience**: Think about what happens after a game ends. What feedback or features could improve the player's experience?

## Notes for Improvement
- **Function Naming**: Consider renaming `pluse` to something more descriptive, like `grow`.
- **Redundant Code**: Refactor the logic for moving and growing the snake to avoid redundancy.
- **Game Reset Logic**: Ensure all game state variables are correctly initialized when resetting.
- **Initialization**: Check that all variables are properly set before use to avoid errors.
- **Screen Updates**: Optimize the frequency of screen updates to enhance game performance.
